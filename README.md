# MountainCar

Gym is a group of environments for developing and testing reinforcement learning algorithms. Mountain car is a one-dimensional environment where the goal of the algorithm is to drive the car through the mountain.
The car does not have enough force to drive in one go so the the algorithm has to drive back and forth to build momentum.

## Setup

-   pip install -r requirements.txt
-   python main.py
